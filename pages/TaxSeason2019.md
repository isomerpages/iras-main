If you received a letter or SMS informing that you have been selected for [NFS](https://www.iras.gov.sg/IRASHome/Individuals/Locals/Filing-your-taxes/Individuals-Required-to-File-Tax/No-Filing-Service--NFS-/), you do not need to file a tax return.

Alternatively, your NOA or tax bill will be sent to you from Jun 2019. Please note that it is your responsibility to ensure that your NOA is accurate. If you have any other income that is not shown in the NOA, or your relief claims in the NOA are incorrect, please inform us within 30 days from the date of your NOA.

 You can use the [check your filing requirements tool](https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/uploadedFiles/IRASHome/Individuals/Check%20your%20tax%20filing%20requirements(1)(1).xls) to check if you need to file a tax return.

### 3) How do I go about filing my tax return?

### 4) Do I need to declare my employment income information?
If your employer is participating in the [Auto-Inclusion Scheme (AIS) for Employment Income](https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/Individuals/Locals/Getting-it-right/Other-Services/Tax-Filing-for-Employees-of-AIS-Employers/), you do not need to declare your employment income information. To check if your employer is participating in AIS and if they have submitted your income information for YA 2019, you may refer to the [AIS Organisation Search](https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/ESVWeb/default.aspx?target=ESubQueryEmployerSubStatusSearch). 

### 5) Do I have to submit my Form IR8A or other supporting documents?
You are not required to submit your Form IR8A or other supporting documents unless specifically stated at the Acknowledgement Page.

### 6) Which income is taxable, which is not?
Generally, all income earned in Singapore is subject to tax. Find out more about the taxability of the different types of [income](https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/Individuals/Locals/Working-Out-Your-Taxes/What-is-Taxable--What-is-Not/) (e.g. employment, trade, etc.).

### 7) Can I claim expenses?
Generally, you may claim tax deductions on expenses 'wholly and exclusively' incurred in earning your income. Find out more about deductions for the different types of [expenses](https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/Individuals/Locals/Working-Out-Your-Taxes/Deductions-for-Individuals--Reliefs--Expenses--Donations-/) (e.g. employment expenses, business expenses, etc.).

With effect from YA 2016, tax filing has been simplified for [rental expenses](https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/Individuals/Locals/Working-Out-Your-Taxes/What-is-Taxable-What-is-Not/Rental-Income-and-Expenses/). You may opt to claim the rental expenses based on 15% of the gross rental income derived from the tenanted residential property, instead of the actual amount of deductible expenses incurred. In addition to the 15%, you may claim a deduction on interest paid on the loan taken to purchase the property. You may use the [rental calculator](https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/uploadedFiles/IRASHome/Individuals/Rental%20calculator.xls) to decide if it is beneficial to claim 15% deemed rental expenses or to claim based on actual rental expenses incurred. Find out more about the [Simplification of Claim of Rental Expenses for Individuals](https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/uploadedFiles/IRASHome/e-Tax_Guides/e-Tax%20Guide_IIT_Simplification_of_Claim_of_Rental_Expenses_for_Individuals.pdf).

### 8) Can I claim personal reliefs and rebates?
You can claim personal reliefs and rebates if you are a Singapore tax resident and have met the qualifying conditions for the [respective reliefs/rebates](https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/Individuals/Locals/Working-Out-Your-Taxes/Deductions-for-Individuals--Reliefs--Expenses--Donations-/) in the preceding year (i.e. 1 Jan to 31 Dec 2018).

You may check your eligibility for the personal reliefs using the [Personal Reliefs Eligibility Tool](https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/uploadedFiles/IRASHome/Quick_Links/Copy%20of%20Personal%20Reliefs%20Eligibility%20Tool.xls)<sup>*</sup> and Parenthood Tax Rebate using the [Parenthood Tax Rebate Tool](https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/uploadedFiles/IRASHome/Individuals/PTR%20calculator.xls).

<sup>*</sup>Works best with Microsoft Office Excel 2007 or later version, incompatible with Microsoft Office Excel for Mac
