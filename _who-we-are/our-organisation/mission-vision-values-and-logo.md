### Logo
![""](/images/agency logo 2.PNG)

An early-day coin, energised by a subtle "S" curve across it, suggests the equivalence of taxes and money matters.

The circular coin with a central square reflects integrity and reason embodied in the tax collection role of IRAS. The sloping "S" curve signifies IRAS' transformation into a service-oriented, professional and efficient statutory authority.

The symbol has our corporate colours of grey and blue to project IRAS as a firm but fair tax administration.

In union, the symbol and colour embody our corporate values and it is a rallying sign for us. It inspires and imbues us with pride in the organisation.
