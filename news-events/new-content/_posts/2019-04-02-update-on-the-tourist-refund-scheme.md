## Advisory on Tourist Refund Scheme

### Update on the Tourist Refund Scheme

The eTRS system will be undergoing upgrading works from 3 to 4 Apr 2019 (Wed and Thur) to serve you better. Due to the upgrading works, it may take longer for tourists to make their GST refund claims. Tourists departing Singapore during this period are advised to arrive at the Airport Terminals early. For more information on tourist refund, please visit our website at [touristrefund.sg](https://touristrefund.sg/index.page).
