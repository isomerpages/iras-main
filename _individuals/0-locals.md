#### Received a letter or SMS about No-Filing Service (NFS)?
If you received a letter or SMS informing that you have been selected for NFS, you do not need to file a tax return. You may log in to myTax.iras.gov.sg to preview your Notice of Assessment (NOA) and request  an early assessment before 19 Apr 2019.
 
 Alternatively, your NOA or tax bill will be sent to you from Jun 2019. Please note that it is your responsibility to ensure that your NOA is accurate. If you have any other income that is not shown in the NOA, or your relief claims in the NOA are incorrect, please inform us within 30 days from the date of your NOA.

#### Do I need to file a tax return?
 You can use the check your filing requirements tool to check if you need to file a tax return.
